My personal website project for Deep Dive Coding.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work defining your purpose/audience/goal and Persona. Although you state that you're interested in targeting both potential clients *and* employers... it does sound like you're leaning more towards working freelance gigs based upon what I'm reading here. 

There is a fair bit of difference between creating content and designing a site that appeals to prospective clients and driving sales vs. one that targets potential employers in IT. While it is certainly possible to design a site that appeals to both, I would consider targeting my design and content to one or the other if you find yourself leaning more towards a specific direction.

Your code looks great, and your site is set up correctly - nice work. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin Milestone 2a.

### Feedback 

Great job on your content strategy. I love how you broke it up based on the different sections of your website. It is very easy to see what exactly you want to accomplish even from an end user's perspective. Everything you laid out in the content strategy should be manageable and not that big of a headache.

The wireframes, for the most part, are also straight foreword. I am little confused about the big X through the Welcome section is that were a photo will be going? The service cards will be deceptively difficult so make sure to budget your time appropriately. I would recommend making your portfolio portraits more square than a rectangle for the desktop view. As for the picture gallery, I would highly recommend Fancy-Box3. Alumni have used it in the past to great success. Be careful with your breakpoints for the contact-me/Who I am section on Desktop if you are not careful the whole section could look cluttered and be hard to read. Finally, recommend having the about me section above the contact me section in the mobile view. The contact section is a natural hard break so it makes sense to have it at the end.
