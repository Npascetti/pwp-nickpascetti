My personal website project for Deep Dive Coding.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work defining your purpose/audience/goal and Persona. Although you state that you're interested in targeting both potential clients *and* employers... it does sound like you're leaning more towards working freelance gigs based upon what I'm reading here. 

There is a fair bit of difference between creating content and designing a site that appeals to prospective clients and driving sales vs. one that targets potential employers in IT. While it is certainly possible to design a site that appeals to both, I would consider targeting my design and content to one or the other if you find yourself leaning more towards a specific direction.

Your code looks great, and your site is set up correctly - nice work. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin Milestone 2a.
